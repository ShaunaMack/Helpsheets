# Git commands

## When and what do we commit?

> How often we commit is quite subjective. Best practice is to commit after step of your workflow is completed. Do we commit after each line? No. We can commit after we have refactored and tested our code.  

### Common Commands
> Remember that all git commands start with the keyword git, this is the program we are running.


## THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE
